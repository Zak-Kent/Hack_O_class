# Python level II Day 1

## Welcome!!!
Thank you all for being willing to take time out of your day to learn some Python! It's our goal in this class to provide students with the skills needed to start making real projects and accessing data using Python. We will be focusing mostly on the backend side of things and will spend most of our time working with APIs, both building them and gathering data from 3rd party sources. This first class will focus on setting things up so we'll be successful throughout the rest of our time together. Below you'll find a list of class objectives and information about the tools we'll be using during the next 8 weeks.

### Tonight's objectives
* Get to know one another
* Class communication channels (Slack, email, GitHub)
* Get working dev environment setup (Python 3, setting up virtualenvs)
* Explain how we will use Git and GitHub (forking repos, setting upstream repo, pushing to fork)
* Introduce Exercism tool and solve a paired code challenge (intro to default dicts)
* Take benchmark Python survey

## Class communication channels

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

#### Virtual environments
* [Article on virtual environments](https://realpython.com/blog/python/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)

## Using Git & GitHub
Throughout this course we will be using Git and GitHub as a convient way to share code with one another and to monitor student's progress. Bellow you'll find useful links to Git tutorials and instructions for how we will share work with one another.
