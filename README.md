# Python level II Day 1

## Welcome!!!
Thank you all for being willing to take time out of your day to learn some Python! It's our goal in this class to provide students with the skills needed to start making real projects and accessing data using Python. We will be focusing mostly on the backend side of things and will spend most of our time working with APIs, both building them and gathering data from 3rd party sources. This first class will focus on setting things up so we'll be successful throughout the rest of our time together. Below you'll find a list of class objectives and information about the tools we'll be using during the next 8 weeks.

### Tonight's objectives
* Get to know one another
* Class communication channels (Slack, email, GitHub)
* Get working dev environment setup (Python 3, setting up virtualenvs)
* Explain how we will use Git and GitHub (forking repos, setting upstream repo, pushing to fork)
* Introduce Exercism tool and solve a paired code challenge (intro to default dicts)
* Take benchmark Python survey

## Class communication channels
* (link to slack)
* Email zak.kent@gmail.com

## Setting up your environment

#### Python 3 install
* [Python 3 install on Mac with Brew](http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/)
* [Main installation page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

#### Text editors
* [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

#### Virtual environments
* [Article on virtual environments](https://realpython.com/blog/python/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)

## Using Git & GitHub
Throughout this course we will be using Git and GitHub as a convient way to share code with one another and to monitor student's progress. Bellow you'll find a link to an interactive GitHub tutorial and instructions for how we will share work with one another.

#### Steps for class GitHub setup
* Fork the class repo to your GitHub account
  * [class repo](https://github.com/Zak-Kent/Hack_O_class)
* Clone the forked repo onto your local machine
  * git clone <github_url_to_forked_repo>
* Run the command `git remote -v` you should see your local fork as `origin`
* Link your forked repo to original
  * [docs on configuring a remote fork](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/)
* Sync your forked repo with the original
  * We will follow the process in the link below to get new code for each day in class
  * [docs on syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)
* Make a branch called `<your_name_day_1>`
* Push the branch you made to your GitHub fork (called `origin`)
